## Analytical dataset

All variables in the analytical set were labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

After the cleaning process 3 variables were included in the analysis with 20 observations.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
and clinical variables
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the
independent t test with Welch correction.
<!-- paired t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- Wilcoxon test. -->
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
Fisher exact test.
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power



<!-- Study groups were balanced and the total sample size was 20 including all groups. -->

<!-- Study groups were not balanced with -->
<!-- group1 with 10 participants -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- group2 with 10 participants -->
<!-- with a total study size of 20. -->
<!-- This power analysis adjusts for different group sizes. -->

<!-- With these group sizes a t test can detect an effect size as large as -->
<!-- **d = 1.32** -->
<!-- with 80% power and 5% significance level (Cohen, 1988). -->

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.1.2.
