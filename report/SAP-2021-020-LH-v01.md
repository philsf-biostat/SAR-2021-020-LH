- CI: confidence interval
- d: Cohen's D effect size
- IQR: interquartile range
- SD: standard deviation

# Context

## Objectives

Determine the sample size to detect the difference of the daily range of Interleukin-6 blood levels between Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficient and healthy patients.

## Hypotheses

The circadian rhythm in patients induces a detectable amplitude between peak and lower daily IL6 levels.
The average IL6 daily amplitudes differ between Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficient and healthy patients.

# Data

## Raw data

A unique study ID will be created for each participant to allow tracking of consecutive IL6 blood level measurements.
IL6 data of each participant will be collected at three different times per day.
Each datum will have its respective date and time of specimen collection recorded.
Participant demographic characteristics to be collected are the group to with they belong (AAT-deficient or healthy), the date of birth, sex and BMI at the date of inclusion.

<!-- The original data base had -->
<!-- 13 -->
<!-- variables collected on -->
<!-- 20 -->
<!-- observations. -->

<!-- Upon study start the raw data will be collected in a raw table, that will be processed before analysis. -->
<!-- The raw dataset to be collected will have -->
<!-- 13 -->
<!-- variables collected on -->
<!-- 20 -->
<!-- observations. -->

<!-- This dataset will include the dates of entry and exit of the cohort, or the date of hospital admission and the date where the endpoint was reached (either an event, or hospital discharge). -->
<!-- Table 1 shows the structure of the raw dataset. -->

<!--   pander(caption = "**Table 1** Raw dataset structure.") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Each row represents all information collected from each study participant, and each participant included will require a unique study ID. -->
<!-- The outcome should be recorded as a binary variable: either the study participant reached the endpoint -->
<!-- ([outcome]) -->
<!-- or reached the end of study period without experiencing the event. -->
<!-- This information can be recorded in either text form (eg, yes/no), or an indicator -->
<!-- ([outcome] = 1, -->
<!-- end of observation time or discharge = 0). -->
<!-- Exposure and all comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->
<!-- All comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->

<!-- Surgery length should be recorded in -->
<!-- minutes, -->
<!-- hours, -->
<!-- and ICU length in -->
<!-- days. -->
<!-- weeks. -->
<!-- months. -->

<!-- Surgery type will be recorded as a categorical variable. -->
<!-- It is recommended that the number of classes (types of surgery) be as small as possible, to avoid loss of precision in the analysis estimates, without the need to increase the sample size. -->
<!-- Broader categories of surgeries should be preferred, whenever possible. -->

After the cleaning process the raw data will include 13 variables.
Table 1 shows the structure of the raw dataset.

## Analytical dataset

<!-- After the cleaning process -->
<!-- 13 -->
<!-- variables were included in the analysis -->
<!-- with -->
<!-- 20 -->
<!-- observations. -->
<!-- After the cleaning process -->
<!-- 13 -->
<!-- variables were included in the analysis. -->
<!-- The total number of observations excluded due to incompleteness and exclusion criteria will be reported in the analysis. -->
<!-- Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset. -->

Age at inclusion will be computed between the date of birth and the date of the first specimen collection.

For each patient the peak level and the lower level of IL6 measurements will be calculated.
The peak level (respectively, lower level) of each patient's IL6 will be calculated as the average of all peak level (respectively, lower level) measurements.
The amplitude of each patient's IL6 blood level will be calculated as the difference between peak level and lower level.

All variables in the analytical set will be labeled according to the raw data provided and values were labeled according to the data dictionary for the preparation of production-quality results tables and figures.

# Study parameters

## Study design

Cross-sectional.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria

N/A

## Exposures

Patients with Antitrypsin deficiency will be compared to controls.

## Outcomes

**Specification of outcome measures** (Zarin, 2011):

1. (Domain) Circadian rythm
2. (Specific measurement) Amplitude of IL6 blood level
3. (Specific metric) End value
4. (Method of aggregation) Average

**Primary outcome**

The primary outcome for the detection of a circadian rhythm will be defined as the amplitude of the IL6 blood level which will be calculated as the difference between the peak level and the lower level of daily measurements.

The secondary outcome will be defined as the the difference between the average IL6 daily amplitude between healthy and AAT-deficient patients.

## Covariates

No covariates will be considered for the sample size calculation.
Age, sex and BMI will be used to adjust the estimates of the primary and secondary outcomes.
Both raw and adjusted estimates will be computed.

# Statistical methods

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

N/A

<!-- The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described. -->
<!-- Demographic -->
<!-- (sex, age and BMI) -->
<!-- and clinical variables -->
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
<!-- will be described as -->
<!-- mean (SD) -->
<!-- median (IQR) -->
<!-- or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate. -->
<!-- The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots. -->

### Inferential analyses

N/A

<!-- All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses. -->
<!-- Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the -->
<!-- independent t test with Welch correction. -->
<!-- paired t test. -->
<!-- Mann-Whitney test. -->
<!-- signed rank Wilcoxon test. -->
<!-- Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the -->
<!-- Fisher exact test. -->
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

N/A

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power



<!-- Study groups were balanced and the total sample size was 20 including all groups. -->

<!-- Study groups were not balanced with -->
<!-- group1 with 10 participants -->
<!-- and -->
<!-- group2 with 10 participants -->
<!-- with a total study size of 20. -->
<!-- This power analysis adjusts for different group sizes. -->

<!-- With these group sizes a t test can detect an effect size as large as -->
<!-- **d = 1.32** -->
<!-- with 80% power and 5% significance level (Cohen, 1988). -->

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.2.1.

# Observations and limitations

**Direction of the difference**

The AAT deficient patient IL6 blood levels may be hypothesized to be lower (higher) than the levels observed healthy patients.
If this hypothesis holds, a left tailed (right tailed) test will have more statistical power to detect significant differences than a two-tailed test.
If there is support in the literature for an educated guess on the direction of the difference this could improve the chance of having significant p-values in the final analysis, at the risk of not detecting a difference in the other direction.

For example, if the hypothesis is specified in the left direction (group of interest has lower levels of IL6 than the healthy group) and the actual observed levels indicate that the group of interest has higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, then the actual difference will likely not be significant in the study.
It is recommended that such decision be made with caution.

<!-- **Recommended reporting guideline** -->

<!-- The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals. -->
<!-- All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014). -->
